## Abstract
Image noise can be generated by different types of inevitable factors, like circuitry and sensor of digital camera, or the environment. One of the most challenging parts in processing images is image denoising, and it is essential for applications, for example, improving image qualities and restoration. While there are already lots of proposed solutions to denoising, people are still trying to improve it, especially with high noise level images. 

In this paper, we attempted to build a CNN-based model that perform well in image denoising. This model utilizes convolutional block channel attention and encoder-decoder network with skip connection. We compared our new method with Residual Encoder-Decoder Networks (REDNet) and Pyramid Real Image Denoising Network (PRIDNet) based on Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD) training dataset. The new method showed promising improvements in two metrics, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). In addition, we tested our trained model on single images and Iphone photos to visualize its denoising effect.
